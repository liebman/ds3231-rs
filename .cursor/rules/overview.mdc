# DS3231 RTC Driver Overview

This is a Rust driver for the DS3231 Real-Time Clock (RTC) using the embedded-hal ecosystem. The driver supports both blocking and async I2C operations.

## Key Files

- [src/lib.rs](mdc:src/lib.rs) - Main driver implementation
- [src/datetime.rs](mdc:src/datetime.rs) - DateTime conversion utilities

## Features

The driver supports several feature flags:
- `async` - Enables async I2C operations
- `log` - Enables standard logging
- `defmt` - Enables defmt logging for embedded systems

## Architecture

The driver uses a dual blocking/async implementation pattern with:
- Register-level abstractions using bitfields
- Error handling with generic I2C errors
- Configuration through strongly-typed enums
- Separate datetime handling logic
