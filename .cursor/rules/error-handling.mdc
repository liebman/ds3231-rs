# Error Handling and Safety Guidelines

The DS3231 driver implements robust error handling and safety features:

## Error Types
Error handling is implemented in [src/lib.rs](mdc:src/lib.rs) with a custom error enum that wraps:
- I2C communication errors
- DateTime validation errors

## Safety Considerations
The driver ensures safety through:
- Strong typing for all register operations
- Validation of all datetime values
- Proper error propagation
- No unsafe code usage

## Best Practices
When using this driver:
1. Always check returned Results
2. Use the Config struct for initialization
3. Handle both I2C and DateTime errors appropriately
4. Use the strongly-typed enums for configuration
