# Async and Blocking Implementation Guide

The DS3231 driver supports both blocking and async I2C operations through a feature-based approach.

## Core Requirements
1. All functionality must be identical between blocking and async implementations
2. Every method available in blocking mode must have an async counterpart
3. Both implementations must maintain feature parity at all times
4. Error handling must be consistent between both modes
5. Tests must verify identical behavior in both modes

## Implementation Pattern
In [src/lib.rs](mdc:src/lib.rs), the dual implementation is achieved through:
- Conditional compilation with #[cfg(feature = "async")]
- Shared types and structures
- Parallel method implementations
- Identical public interfaces

## Key Components
- Base driver struct remains the same
- Methods are conditionally compiled
- Error types handle both variants
- Configuration is shared between modes
- All register operations available in both modes
- All features accessible through both interfaces

## Usage Guidelines
1. Enable the "async" feature for async support
2. Use appropriate embedded-hal or embedded-hal-async trait implementations
3. Error handling remains consistent between modes
4. All functionality must be accessible regardless of chosen mode
5. Documentation must cover both implementations equally
